OYE is the final project to achieve certification as a NextU.com frontend developer.
The challenge is to create a music sharing site that contains a page with the top 3 most played songs, a page where all stored songs can be found, a registration page and a login page.
The site implements javascript, html, css and bootstrap.
The top 3 must use a json file loaded via ajax.
